A single-file, offline notebook that lets you think fast, organize ideas, and stay portable.

My desktop's power supply failed, so I'm back on the laptop and took another run at Obsidian. I never quite stick with it; no amount of customization or "cool" graph view makes it useful beyond name-dropping connections. So I finally built the thing I've been overthinking for years: a dead-simple memex/Zettelkasten that encourages using the whole workspace instead of burying notes. It's modeled on the original slipbox, reimagined as piles you can stack and order by position in the app, then combine into a single ordered output.

Synaps.ing is my take on a personal Zettelkasten: a browser-native notebook that runs as a single HTML/JS file, looks like parchment, and behaves like a well-organized desk ready for ideas. Notes are Markdown (.md) with JSON under the hood. Everything lives locally, no cloud required. Export/import makes backups trivial. Link with [[note]]; build hierarchies with >>subnote>>. Not mobile-friendly... yet. This is likely what I'll be focusing on while the tower gets repaired.

Core Features
- Single-file, offline-capable notebook
- Linked Markdown with cross-stack navigation
- In-place hierarchies (convert note to subnote or parent note)
- Auto-save with local version history
- Layered “paper” interface with stack breadcrumbs
- Export and import to JSON and Markdown
